## Project1: Todo App
It is like a daily task managing app, where you can add all your tasks you want to do today.
You can also mark the task completed when you complete and you can also delete a task based on requirements.
Your tasks will be saved on local storage so it allows you track your activity when you accendetly closed the browser.
